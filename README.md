# Pokemon-Dodge-School-Project-
Pokemon Dodge is an action game which mechanics are similar to Minion Rush game, where you must drive your Pokemon through an infinite map, trying constantly to dodge obstacles and other danger that will appear in the way.

Currently the code is still represented by black blocks that fall randomly the screen, in which you have to dodge to an object (red car).
The game_intro() method was created and is described in the penultimate line of code not working yet.
The next step is to create an array with 3 positions for restricted movement of objects.
